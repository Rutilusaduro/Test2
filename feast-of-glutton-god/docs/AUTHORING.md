# Text Engine Authoring Guide

> **Audience: you, the LLM (or human) about to write game prose.** Read this whole file before writing or editing ANY narrative text. The engine reference is `docs/modular-text-system.md`; this file is the content contract. The canonical exemplar files to copy are `src/textEngine/scenes/weighIn/` and `src/textEngine/scenes/talkEncourage.js`.

## 0. Prime directive

**Never register a monolithic paragraph as a variant.** If a text you are about to write is longer than ~200 characters, it is a *skeleton* candidate: break it into a skeleton template plus fragment slots. The whole point of this system is that fragments mix and match combinatorially — one 4-fragment sentence with 5 options per slot yields 625 readable sentences; one handwritten paragraph yields 1. `npm run text:lint` enforces this (error at >200 chars in pool modules).

The second rule: **the player rereads this prose hundreds of times.** Variety, personality, and state-reactivity are the product. A line that ignores the girl's mood, body type, or hunger when those should obviously change it is a bug.

## 1. Mental model

Two layers, always:

1. **Skeletons** — short sentence templates containing slots, registered as the *beat* module (e.g. `wi.arrival`). A beat has 3-6 skeleton shapes so sentence rhythm varies, not just word choice.
2. **Fragments** — small pools of words/clauses/dialogue beats that fill the slots (e.g. `wi.moveVerb`, `wi.bodyClause`). Each fragment variant declares `when` selectors; the engine picks among ALL matching variants, weighted toward specificity.

```js
import { registerPool } from '../engine.js';

registerPool("wi.arrival", [
  { when: {}, text: [
    "{subject.name} {wi.pace} {wi.moveVerb} {wi.doorway}{join:wi.bodyClause,wi.faceClause|prefix:, }.",
    "{subject.name} {wi.moveVerb} in{join:wi.bodyClause,wi.soundClause|prefix:, }.",
  ]},
]);

registerPool("wi.bodyClause", [
  { when: {}, text: ["", "", "her steps unhurried"] },                       // weighted-empty: clause often omitted
  { when: { bodyType: ["pear", "hourglass"], stageMin: 6 }, text: [
    "her wide hips catching briefly in the door",
    "her hips brushing both sides of the frame",
  ]},
  { when: { bodyType: "topHeavy", stageMin: 6 }, text: [
    "her heavy bust arriving a beat before she does",
  ]},
]);
```

### `registerPool` vs `registerModule`

- **`registerPool` — the default for ALL new content.** Every matching variant stays RNG-eligible; weight = `(variant.weight ?? 1) * 3^specificity`. A 2-condition variant beats a wildcard 9:1, so specific flavor usually wins but generic lines surface as spice (~10-25%).
- **`registerModule` ('best' mode) — legacy/suppressive.** Most specific match wins outright. Use ONLY when less-specific variants must be *impossible*, not just rare (e.g. `talk.coda` registers an empty wildcard so the coda is silent unless a corruption register fires).
- `weight` raises/lowers a variant's share (`weight: 4` on persona variants keeps the girl's own voice dominant; `weight: 0` parks a draft).
- `priority` in pool mode is a **hard gate**: only max-priority matches survive. Use rarely and document why in a comment.

### Consequence of pooling: generic fragments must be tone-neutral

There are no NOT-conditions. A wildcard fragment can fire while the girl is in withdrawal, grieving, or ecstatic — so wildcard texts must read correctly under ANY state ("she crosses the room" ✓, "she bounces in cheerfully" ✗ — key that one on `mood`).

## 2. Grammar-shape contracts

Every fragment pool has ONE grammatical shape. Mixing shapes inside a pool breaks every skeleton that uses it. Declare the shape in a comment above each pool.

| Shape | Rules | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **ADVERBIAL** | lowercase, no punctuation | `without hurry`, `with single-minded momentum` |
| **VERB PHRASE** | lowercase, follows a subject, no punctuation | `waddles`, `angles sideways through` |
| **PARTICIPLE CLAUSE** | lowercase, no leading cap, no trailing period; reads after a comma | `her wide hips catching briefly in the door` |
| **FULL SENTENCE** | Capitalized, ends with `.` (or `!?`) | `The dial holds at {subject.lbs}.` |
| **DIALOGUE BEAT** | Full sentence(s) containing a quote + attribution | `"Coach would lose his mind. I don't care," she says.` |

### Idioms

- **Optional clause group:** `{join:wi.bodyClause,wi.faceClause|prefix:, }` — resolves both, drops empties, glues survivors with `, ` + final `and`, and only emits the leading `, ` if anything survived. This is THE way to stack body/mood clauses onto a sentence.
- **Optional single slot:** `{wi.moodTag|prefix: }` — leading space only when non-empty.
- **Sometimes-omit:** put `""` entries in the wildcard pool (each `""` is one share of the RNG). Two empties + one text ≈ 33% emission at wildcard.
- **Weight callout:** `{subject.lbs}` (rounded number), `{subject.name}`, `{subject.first}`.
- **Smoothing gotcha:** the smoothing pass capitalizes after `. ` and at string start, but NOT after `\n\n` — fragments that open a paragraph must be authored capitalized or piped through `|cap`.
- Never name a module `join` (reserved). Never use `{` or `}` in prose (write `{{` for a literal brace).

## 3. Selector cookbook

All keys combine (AND within a variant; value arrays are OR). Unlisted keys are looked up on `ctx.d` directly.

## 4. Per-girl persona conventions

- Persona variants live in a dedicated `personas.js` next to the scene (see `scenes/weighIn/personas.js`), registered into the SAME slot keys via `registerModuleVariants` — they extend the shared pool, they don't replace it.
- Key on `studentId` (+ `corruption`, + wide `stageMin/stageMax` ranges so several lines co-pool) and set `weight: 4` so the girl's own voice dominates without silencing shared fragments.
- **Dialogue is sacred:** when migrating handwritten lines, keep quoted speech verbatim — the voice lives in the quotes. Narration around quotes may be genericized.
- Aim for ≥2 dialogue beats per girl per corruption tier in any slot that carries personality.

## 5. Authoring a new scene (checklist)

1. New file under `src/textEngine/scenes/` (or a folder for multi-file scenes). Register scene-local modules at import time; export template constants + a `renderX()` wrapper. Namespace keys (`wi.*`, `enc.*`, `<feature>.*`).
2. Add the file to `src/textEngine/scenes/index.js` (the barrel — lint and DebugPanel sweep it).
3. Every pool: a `when: {}` wildcard variant (lint errors otherwise), ≥3 wildcard texts, one grammar shape, a shape comment.
4. Decide which axes the scene should react to (stage? bodyType? mood? hunger? per-girl?) and write keyed variants for the top 2-3 axes minimum.
5. `npm run text:lint` — must be clean for your keys. Then `npm run lint`.
6. Eyeball renders: DebugPanel sweep buttons, or `node --input-type=module -e "import './src/textEngine/scenes/index.js'; import { createContext, render } from './src/textEngine/engine.js'; ..."`.

## 6. Anti-patterns

- **Monolith variant** — a paragraph as `text`. Decompose. (Lint error in pools.)
- **Missing wildcard** — module goes silent/crashes coverage in unforeseen states. (Lint error in pools.)
- **Shape mixing** — a full sentence inside a participle-clause pool mangles every skeleton downstream.
- **Slot overreach** — a `wi.bodyClause` that also describes her face does the neighbor slot's job; combined output reads twice-described.
- **Tone-loaded generics** — wildcard fragments with strong affect undercut mood/withdrawal-keyed contexts.
- **Re-registering a key** — overwrites silently in prod (dev warns). Check the namespace before naming.
- **Paraphrasing mined dialogue** — kills the character voice that playtesters already know.
- **`gameHelpers.rnd` vs `pick`** — `rnd(a,b)` is an int range, `pick(arr)` picks from an array. Never mix.
