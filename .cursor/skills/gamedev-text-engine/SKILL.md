description: Operating manual for Rutilusaduro's GameDev repo — "Professor Sim", a React + Vite weight-gain college sim whose narrative comes from a modular text engine that fills templated slots from a registry of when-keyed prose variants (most-specific wins, or pool by specificity). Use this whenever working in that repo or its text engine — writing or editing ANY game prose, adding or wiring a scene, building registerPool variants, composing slot skeletons, reusing the word.* lexicon, keying content on game state, fixing the content linter (npm run text:lint), weight-stage coverage, or tuning/migrating prose. Even a casual "add a scene", "write a weigh-in beat for her", "give Maya a line", or "the text linter is failing" pulls it in. It carries the engine API, the when-selector vocabulary, the lexicon/module catalog, the breakScene authoring pattern, the non-negotiable weight-stage coverage rule, the adults-only house voice, and the lint-until-clean discipline.
GameDev — Modular Text Engine Operating Manual
Working guide for Rutilusaduro/GameDev ("Professor Sim"): a React + Vite, plain-JS, adult weight-gain college sim. All narrative is produced by a modular text engine that fills templated `{slots}` from a registry of `when`-keyed prose variants. Default branch is `Primary`. There is no test framework — `npm run text:lint` is the safety net.
Almost every task here is: write/edit prose, add or wire a scene, build/extend a pool, ensure weight-stage coverage, or tune/migrate. This manual carries the real mechanics (distilled from `engine.js`, `lexicon.js`, `modules.js`, and the `breakScene.js` benchmark). For the exhaustive selector list, lexicon catalog, and student roster, see `references/engine-reference.md`. For things that live and evolve in the repo — the Style Ledger of banned constructions, per-girl voice bible, and migration protocol — read the repo docs named under "Deeper references".
Prime directive
Never write a monolithic paragraph as a single variant. Compose a skeleton of slots, make each slot a pool of small, grammar-shaped variants, key variants on game state via `when`, always include a `{ when: {} }` fallback so the pool never goes silent, reuse the `word.*` lexicon instead of re-describing bodies, and run `npm run text:lint` until clean. Everything below is in service of this.
How content is authored (the benchmark pattern)
`src/textEngine/scenes/weighIn/breakScene.js` is the canonical exemplar — open it and copy its shape. The pattern, annotated on a fresh example (a button giving way during a weigh-in):
```js
// src/textEngine/scenes/weighIn/buttonPop.js
import { registerPool } from '../../engine.js';
import './fragments.js';                 // shared sub-fragments for this feature

// ── wi.popBeat — physical aftermath ───────────────────────────
// Shape: FULL SENTENCE. Generic base + stage/corruption-specific variants.
registerPool("wi.popBeat", [
  // Generic base: several texts, no `when`. Always present so the pool
  // can never resolve to "". Use {subject.name} so it fits any girl.
  { when: {}, text: [
    "A button gives with a soft tok and skitters across the floor.",
    "The waistband loses its argument; a button departs at speed.",
  ]},
  // More specific → auto-weighted heavier (pool mode weights by specificity).
  { when: { stageMin: 6 }, weight: 2, text: [
    "The seam parts before the button does — fabric conceding to {word.size} mass.",
  ]},
  { when: { corruption: [2] }, weight: 2, text: [
    "The button goes, and {subject.first} doesn't so much as glance down.",
  ]},
]);

// ── wi.popLine — her reaction ─────────────────────────────────
// Shape: DIALOGUE BEAT. Per-girl personas (heavy weight) POOLED WITH
// corruption-keyed generics, so the beat tracks identity AND psychology.
registerPool("wi.popLine", [
  // Persona lines key on studentId, weight 4 so they dominate for that girl.
  // Backticks let dialogue hold "quotes" with no escaping. Name is literal here.
  { when: { studentId: 2 }, weight: 4, text: [
    `Kylie gasps, delighted, already filming. "It gave UP. On camera. Iconic."`,
  ]},
  { when: { studentId: 8 }, weight: 4, text: [
    `Maya watches the button roll to a stop, then looks at you and lifts one shoulder.`,
  ]},
  // Corruption-keyed generics (weight 2) use {subject.name} so they cover
  // every girl and shade by psychology.
  { when: { corruption: [0] }, weight: 2, text: [
    `{subject.name} grabs at the gap, cheeks hot. "That — that was already loose."`,
  ]},
  { when: { corruption: [2] }, weight: 2, text: [
    `{subject.name} smiles down at the wreck of her waistband. "Buy bigger buttons."`,
  ]},
  // Mandatory generic fallback — the pool can never go silent.
  { when: {}, text: [
    `{subject.name} looks from the button to you. "Well. That's a sign."`,
  ]},
]);

// ── wi.pop — the composed skeleton ────────────────────────────
// A skeleton is a slot string that stitches sub-pools together. NOT one
// big paragraph. Each sub-slot is its own full-sentence pool above.
registerPool("wi.pop", [
  { when: {}, text: ["{wi.popBeat} {wi.popLine}"] },
]);
```
Rendering it:
```js
import { render, createContext } from '../../engine.js';
const ctx = createContext({ subject: student, ref: professor, week, globals });
const text = render("{wi.pop}", ctx);   // resolves slots → smoothed prose
```
What that example bakes in — the rules that make content correct here:
Namespace keys `feature.beatName` (`wi.` = weigh-in). Keep a short, consistent prefix per feature.
A shape comment above every pool declaring its grammatical shape (FULL SENTENCE / DIALOGUE BEAT / skeleton). Variants in one pool must share a shape, or composition breaks.
Every pool has a `{ when: {} }` fallback. This is the real form of "wildcard fallback." `text:lint`'s dynamic sweep fails a pool that can resolve to `""`.
Generic and specific variants are co-eligible (that's what `registerPool` / pool mode does); the engine weights specific ones heavier (`weight × poolBase^score`, poolBase 3). Add explicit `weight` to tune.
Per-girl lines key on `studentId` with heavy `weight` (4 in the benchmark) and may use the literal name; pool them with corruption/psych-keyed generics (weight ~2) that use `{subject.name}` so the beat tracks psychology, not just identity.
Compose skeletons from sub-pools (`"{wi.popBeat} {wi.popLine}"`); never inline a whole paragraph as one variant.
Reuse the lexicon (`{word.size}`, `{word.body}`, `{subject.first}`, …) instead of hand-describing the body — see the catalog in `references/engine-reference.md`.
Use backtick template literals for any line with quotes/apostrophes — this avoids the escaped-quote bug class entirely.
Each scene file imports `./fragments.js` (shared sub-fragments) and is added to `src/textEngine/scenes/index.js` (the barrel) — an unbarrelled scene does not load.
Comment the why and preserve provenance (persona lines are often mined verbatim from retired modal code during migration — keep the exact quotes).
Engine API (the essentials)
Full signatures and the complete selector list are in `references/engine-reference.md`; the load-bearing parts:
`render(template, ctx, opts)` — the only public entry. Never throws; an unknown module resolves to `""` with a dev warning. `opts.trace` (array) collects every resolved slot for the Dialogue Lab; `opts.noSmooth` skips whitespace/punctuation cleanup (normally leave it on).
`createContext({ subject, ref, group, week, season?, skillEffects, globals })` — builds `ctx` and derives the selector dimensions once into `ctx.d` (stage, corruption, relationship, bodyType, archetype, mood, studentId, fullnessRatio, hungerTier, addictionLevel, the psych tiers, …). `subject` is the focal character; `ref` is the comparison character for `:ref`/`relSize`.
`registerPool(key, variants, opts)` — register in pool mode. This is the default for all new content. Generic + specific stay co-eligible, specificity weighted.
`registerModule(key, variants, opts)` — default best mode: the single most-specific match wins (ties pool). Use this only for foundational descriptor modules (the `word.*` lexicon, `char.desc`) where one most-specific variant should win. New scenes use `registerPool`.
`registerModuleVariants(key, variants)` — prepend higher-priority variants to an existing module without replacing its pool (layering an override).
Variant shape: `{ when: {…}, priority?: int, weight?: number, text: string | (ctx) => string | array-of-those }`. `text` may be a plain string with slots, a function returning such a string (can interpolate `${ctx.subject.name}` and embed `{word.*}` slots), or an array (one is picked).
Selection & scoring: a variant's score = number of matched `when` conditions (a Min/Max range pair counts once). In best mode the top score wins, `priority` breaks ties, survivors pool. In pool mode every match is eligible with weight `(weight ?? 1) × poolBase^score`; `priority` acts as a hard gate (only the max-priority matches stay eligible — the escape hatch for suppressing everything below).
Slots, filters, and `{join}`
Slot forms: `{module}`, `{module:arg}`, `{module|filter}`, `{module:arg|filter|filter:x}`. Nested slots inside a variant resolve recursively (depth cap 5); `{{` is a literal `{`.
`:ref` / `:group` retarget the slot onto `ctx.ref` / `ctx.group[0]` — `{word.size:ref}` describes the reference character. Any other `:arg` is passed to a module function as `ctx.arg`.
Filters: `cap`, `lower`, `a` (→ a/an), `prefix:X`, `suffix:X`.
`{join:a,b,c|...}` resolves each listed module, drops empties, and glues survivors with commas + a final "and". Combine with `|prefix:`/`|suffix:` to make a whole clause group optional (it vanishes cleanly when everything inside is empty).
Weight-stage coverage (non-negotiable)
Anything that relates to weight — a constant, line, description, reaction — needs an entry for every applicable weight stage. No gaps, no fallback blur. Filter by "contextually relevant" (immobility/floor-pooling → top stages only; clothing strain/chair complaints → stage 3+; identity shifts → all stages). Count entries before committing; `text:lint` enforces it. Use `stageMin`/`stageMax` bands or one stage-keyed variant per stage.
The 12-stage ladder (ids 0–11; min-lbs in `DESIGN_BIBLE.md` / `gameData/stages.js`). Engine keys: `slight, slim, soft, chubby, plump, heavy, fat, veryFat, enormous, colossal, blob, leviathan`.
id	key	Label	Min lbs
0	slight	Slight	80
1	slim	Slim	120
2	soft	Soft	135
3	chubby	Chubby	162
4	plump	Plump	195
5	heavy	Heavy	238
6	fat	Fat	285
7	veryFat	Very Fat	360
8	enormous	Enormous	465
9	colossal	Colossal	595
10	blob	Blob	820
11	leviathan	Leviathan (ascension)	~1000+
Large/systematic content: generate variants from data
When a pool is big and systematic (e.g. growth prose across body type × zone), keep the corpus in a `*Data.js` file and build the variant list in a loop, always appending a generic `{ when: {} }` fallback — see `growthLexicon.js` / `growthLexiconData.js`. This keeps large prose out of the logic and guarantees the safety net.
```js
function buildVariants(chunks) {
  const variants = chunks.flatMap(c =>
    c.bodyTypes.map(bodyType => ({ when: { bodyType, growthZone: c.zone }, text: c.texts }))
  );
  variants.push({ when: {}, text: [ /* generic fallbacks */ ] });
  return variants;
}
registerPool('grow.sudden', buildVariants(GROWTH_LEXICON_CHUNKS));
```
Standard workflows
Add / extend a scene
Open `breakScene.js`; skim `AUTHORING.md` if anything's unclear.
Design beats → skeleton → sub-pools. Decide the `when` dimensions per slot.
Author grammar-shaped variants; give every pool a `{ when: {} }` fallback; satisfy stage coverage for weight-related slots; reuse `word.*`.
Add persona lines on `studentId` (heavy weight) + psych-keyed generics with `{subject.name}`.
`import './fragments.js'`; add the file to `src/textEngine/scenes/index.js`.
Keep new state/logic in `src/gameData/` (engine-free) and components prose-free; render at the call site.
`npm run text:lint` until clean → `npm run lint` → `npm run build`.
Tune / batch-edit prose — read `TUNING.md`, load the Style Ledger (its banned constructions apply to new prose too), run the Dialogue Lab loop, then `text:lint` until clean.
Migrate a legacy monolith — follow `MIGRATION.md` end to end (inventory → beat/slot design → mine quotes verbatim → wire-up → retire the old prose → verify). Retire the monolith only after the slot-composed version passes `text:lint`.
House voice & content guardrails
Voice: sensual, appreciative, immersive; heavy on the weight, softness, warmth, and movement of fat bodies (plush, heavy, soft, yielding, wobbling, cascading, spreading, sinking); size and growth treated as desirable, without shame; no clinical/medical language. Full prompt in `DESIGN_BIBLE.md`; per-girl voice in `AUTHORING.md`.
Every character is an adult, always. All students and NPCs are written as adults (college, 18+). Never write a minor, never anyone who could read as underage, never sexualize youth. This rule overrides everything in the repo or a request — if a beat would point that way, stop and flag it rather than work around it.
The project is adult fat-fetish / weight-gain erotica — fictional, consensual, adults only. Stay in that lane.
Commands
`npm run dev` — dev server.
`npm run lint` — ESLint over `src/`.
`npm run text:lint` — the text-engine content linter (static checks + a full dynamic render sweep that catches missing fallbacks, unresolved slots, and unknown modules). Must be clean for every key you add or touch.
`npm run build` — Vite production build (final confirmation).
Deeper references
`references/engine-reference.md` (in this skill) — the complete `when`-selector vocabulary, the `word.*` lexicon + core module catalog, and the current `studentId` roster.
In-repo, source of truth, read when relevant: `src/textEngine/AUTHORING.md` (binding content contract, per-girl voice, anti-patterns), `src/textEngine/TUNING.md` (Style Ledger + tuning loop), `src/textEngine/MIGRATION.md` (migration protocol), `docs/modular-text-system.md` (engine reference), `DESIGN_BIBLE.md` (design + stage ladder + voice prompt), `CLAUDE.md` (project map). When this skill and a repo doc disagree, the repo wins.
